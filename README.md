# My Favorite Books

My Favorite Books is a simple Rails app that lets users rate books theyâ€™ve read and add them to a master list of books. It also allows them to rate books added by other users. A user is able to create an account, either by setting their email and password or authenticating through Facebook, add new books and ratings, edit books and ratings they created, and logout.  


This is my Rails Portfolio Project for Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development course.
